\chapter{A view of the EoR window from the PAPER-32 imaging array}
\label{chapter:eor_window_paper32img}

In this Section, we present 2D power spectra created from data taken by the PAPER-32 imaging array in Stokes I, Q, U and V. 

The PAPER 32-antenna array relied on its highly redundant configuration in order to take the measurements resulting in the strong upper limits on the 21 cm power spectrum \citep{Parsons.14, Jacobs.15, Moore.17}. However, for three nights in 2011 September, the 32 elements were reconfigured into an polarized imaging configuration. 
Creating power spectra allowed us to observe and diagnose systematic effects in our calibration at high signal-to-noise within the Fourier space most relevant to EoR experiments. We observed well-defined windows in the Stokes visibilities, with Stokes Q, U and V power spectra sharing a similar wedge shape to that seen in Stokes I.  With modest polarization calibration, we saw no evidence that polarization calibration errors moved power outside the wedge in any Stokes visibility, to the noise levels attained. Deeper integrations will be required to confirm that this behavior persists to the depth required for EoR detection.

The layout of this Chapter is as follows.  In Section~\ref{sec:psa32_obs} we provide a brief description of the PAPER array in its imaging configuration, the data from which this paper is based, and describe its calibration and reduction. We also describe the method used to create 2D power spectra in this section. We analyze the power spectra in Section~\ref{sec:psa32_res}, and discuss the implications of our findings and conclude in Section~\ref{sec:psa32_disc}.

\section{Observations \& Reduction}
\label{sec:psa32_obs}
We present measurements taken overnight on 2011 September 14--15 over local sidereal times (LSTs) 0--5 hr.

Antennae were arranged in a pseudo-random scatter within a 300\,m-diameter circle, the layout of which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:psa32img_config}. This allowed us to obtain resolutions between 15' and 25' across the bandwidth (100--200 MHz nominally, although in reality this extends 110--185 MHz due to band edge effects and VHF TV). Drift-scan visibilities were measured every 10.7 s, and divided into datasets about 10 minutes in length. We express an interferometric visibility $V^{pq}_{ij}$ between antennae $i$ (with dipole arm $p$, which can be $x$ (East-West) or $y$ (North-South) for PAPER dipoles), and $j$ (with dipole arm $q$), in directional cosines $l$ and $m$ for frequency $\nu$ at time $t$, as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
V_{ij}^{pq}(\nu,t) = g^p_i g^{q*}_j \exp(-2\pi i \nu \tau_{pq}) \times \\ \int d\Omega \, A^{pq}(\Omega, \nu)
S(\Omega, \nu) \exp\left(\frac{ -i\nu}{c} \vec{b}(t) \cdot \hat{s}(\Omega)\right)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:psa32_visibility}
\end{equation}

where the $g$ terms represent the complex gains for each antenna and dipole arm, $A^{pq}$ is the polarized beam and $S$ is the sky. The product $\vec{b}(t) \cdot \hat{s}(\Omega)$ represents the projection of the baseline between $i$ and $j$ with respect to an arbitrary location on the sky. 
The motivation for including the term for the delay between dipole arms $p$ and $q$, $\tau_{pq}$, is given in Section \ref{subsubsec:psa32_polcal}. This delay is clearly zero if $p=q$.

Visibilities were obtained from correlating both $x$ and $y$ dipoles, forming V$^{xx}$, V$^{xy}$, V$^{yx}$ and V$^{yy}$. Frequencies from 100 to 200\,MHz were sampled into 2048 channels.
Data were delay-filtered to 203 frequency channels \citep[see the Appendix of][]{Parsons.14} and Chapter~\ref{chapter:data_prep_and_proc}.  Cross-talk was modelled and removed by subtracting the average power over the 5 hours of observation, which extended across LST=0h--5h. An initial RFI-flagging removed any outliers more than $6\sigma$ from a spectrally smooth profile.

\subsection{Calibration}

Calibration took place in three stages, detailed below: a first-order delay-space calibration for the initial gains and phases with respect to Pictor A, an absolute calibration using imaging with respect to Pictor A and Fornax A, and a polarimetric correction for the $\tau_{xy}$ phase term in the V$^{xy}$ and V$^{yx}$ visibilities. 
Traditional polarimetric calibration proceeds by observing a source with a known polarization angle, and solving for up to seven direction-independent terms in the Jones matrix \citep[e.g.][]{TMS, HBS.1.96}, as well correcting for the effects of the primary beam. 
Given the dearth of suitable calibrators at our observing frequencies, especially at the relatively low resolution and sensitivity of the array, we proceeded with polarized calibration using different techniques, as described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:psa32_polcal} below.

\subsubsection{Initial calibration}
A first-order gain and phase calibration was performed by a similar approach to \citet{Jacobs.13}. Each 10~minute drift-scan dataset was phased to the known position of Pictor A using {\tt aipy} routines.

The gain term in Equation \ref{eq:psa32_visibility} was approximated as 
\begin{equation}
 g^p_i = G^p_i \exp(-2\pi i \nu \tau_{ip})
\end{equation}
and the required delay $\tau_{ip}$ offset of the uncalibrated delay tracks to the real position on the sky solved for to obtain a phase calibration; the absolute flux calibration $G^p_i$ was found by isolating the tracks of Pictor A in delay space, and applying the required flux scale across the band \citep[for a discussion of delay-space calibration, see][and Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_delay_spectra}]{Parsons.12a}.

\subsubsection{Absolute Calibration}
\label{subsubsec:psa32_abscal}

Visibilities were converted to {\tt CASA} Measurement Sets to be further calibrated using a custom pipeline developed around {\tt CASA} libraries. Snapshot images were generated for each 10~minute observation by Fourier transforming the visibilities. 
We used uniform weights and the multi-frequency synthesis algorithm to further improve the $uv$~coverage. 
Dirty images were deconvolved down to a 5~Jy threshold using the Cotton-Schwab algorithm. 
The sky model generated by the CLEAN components was used to self-calibrate each snapshot over the full bandwidth, using a frequency-independent sky-model and averaging over the 10~minute observation.
We corrected for residual cable length errors by computing antenna-based phase solutions for each frequency channel for each snapshot observation. 
After self-calibration, snapshot visibilities were again Fourier transformed into images and deconvolved down to a 2~Jy threshold to form the final sky models. 
These final sky models were used to solve for a frequency independent, diagonal, complex Jones matrix \citep{HBS.1.96,Smirnov.11} for each antenna in order to calibrate gain variations from snapshot to snapshot. 
We make no attempt to correct sky models for polarized primary beams and, therefore, our gain solutions incorporate both the direction independent and the direction dependent responses of the two gain polarizations. 
This is a reasonable approximation for the scope of the paper, as, eventually, wide-field polarization corrections cannot be implemented directly in the per-baseline 
power spectrum estimation (see Section~\ref{sec:psa32_res}).

The average correction in magnitude through this second-order calibration was a $\pm$6\% change for $x$ gains and $\pm$7\% for $y$ gains from those derived in the initial delay-space calibration.
If the gain on an antenna deviated by more than 30\% from image-to-image during this analysis, it was discarded from future processing stages, since it was likely malfunctioning. This was true for 3 antennae (see the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:psa32img_config}).

\label{fig:psa32_sky_image}
\end{figure*}

The final gain amplitude calibration was carried out similarly to \citet{Ali.15}. We generated single channel images between 120 and 174 MHz for each snapshot and deconvolved each of them down to 10 Jy. For each snapshot, a source spectrum is derived for Pictor A by fitting a two dimensional Gaussian the source using the {\tt PyBDSM}\footnote{\url{http://www.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=public:user software:pybdsm}} source extractor \citep{pybdsm}. Spectra were optimally averaged together by weighting them with the primary beam model evaluated in the direction of Pictor A. To fit the absolute calibration, we divided the model spectrum \citep{Jacobs.13} by the measured one and fit a 6th order polynomial over the 120-174 MHz frequency range. This procedure was repeated using Fornax A with the only difference that a taper was applied to the visibilities (120\,m) in order to reduce Fornax A to a point-like source and use the model spectrum from \citet{Bernardi.13}. The best fit coefficients for Pictor A and Fornax A were averaged together to obtain the final absolute flux density calibration. Snapshots of fully CASA-calibrated data are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_sky_image}.

\subsubsection{Polarimetric factors}
\label{subsubsec:psa32_polcal}
Standard full polarization calibration involves correcting for leakage of Stokes~$I$ into the $V_{ij}^{xy}$ and $V_{ij}^{yx}$ visibilities and leakage of polarized signal into total intensity (the so called Jones $D$ matrices or $D$-terms; e.g. \citet[][]{TMS, HBS.1.96}), and an unknown phase difference between the $x$ and $y$ feeds \citep[e.g.][]{Sault.96}. 

We attempt no $D$ matrix calibration in this paper, as there is not a dominant source to be used for such calibration: the limited sensitivity of our observations does not offer good signal-to-noise ratio on PMN~J0351-2744, the only  polarized source at low frequencies known so far in our survey area.  In addition, $D$-term calibration would require determination of the primary beam Mueller matrices beyond our current accuracy. The consequences of this limitation are discussed in the analysis of our power spectra in Section~\ref{sec:psa32_res}.  

As a intermediate measure compatible with these limitations, we therefore adopted a minimization of the phase difference between the $V_{ij}^{xy}$ and $V_{ij}^{yx}$ visibilities, minimizing a sum of squared weighted residuals $w$:

\begin{equation}
w(\nu,\,t,\,\tau_{xy}) = \sum_{ij} | V_{ij}^{xy} - V_{ij}^{yx}\exp(-2\pi i \nu \tau_{xy}) |^2
\end{equation}
to find an estimated value of $\tau_{xy}$ for the array at each $(\nu,\,t)$ sample. This is equivalent to assuming that the sky is intrinsically not circularly polarized at the frequencies observed by PAPER.

We choose not to correct for ionospheric Faraday rotation in our calibration. Not only is this difficult to do for widefield instruments, but also the ionosphere was relatively stable during the observations, so we expect little incoherent averaging during the power spectrum stage below. We calculated the stability of ionospheric RM ($\phi_{\rm iono}$) using the {\sc ionFR} software \citep{Sotomayor-Beltran.13}, which calculates the $\phi_{\rm iono}$ for a given longitude, latitude and time by interpolating values of GPS-derived total electron content maps and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field \citep{Finlay.10}. The values of $\phi_{\rm iono}$ for different lines of sight are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:psa32img_ionosphere}. 
Fluctuations of $\phi_{\rm iono}$ will cause incoherent time-averaging and subsequent loss of polarized signal. Using the formalism of \citet{Moore.17} to calculate the attenuation factor, we found that none of the lines of sight (except for the 21h,0$^{\circ}$ one which goes beneath the horizon) shown are responsible for attenuating signal by $>\,20\%$ in power-spectrum space (see Section~\ref{subsec:psa32_create_pspec}).

\label{fig:psa32img_ionosphere}
\end{figure}


We form linear combinations of the instrument visibilities, the so-called pseudo-Stokes visibilities \citep[see e.g.][]{Moore.13} $V^I,\,V^Q,\,V^U$ and $V^V$ as:

\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
V^{I}\\
V^{Q}\\
V^{U}\\
V^{V}\end{array} \right)
=
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & -i & i & 0 \end{array} \right) 
\left(\begin{array}{c}
V^{xx}\\
V^{xy}\\
V^{yx}\\
V^{yy}\end{array} \right) 
\label{eq:psa32_stokes}
\end{equation}

Data that were reduced, calibrated, and formed into Stokes visibilities were separated into delay spectra inside and outside of the horizon for each baseline. We used a 50\,ns margin for what was considered `inside' the horizon, in order to confine all supra-horizon emission \citep[e.g.][]{Parsons.12a, Pober.13} to the foreground component of the data. We implemented a one-dimensional CLEAN \citep{ParsonsBacker.09, Parsons.12b} with a Blackman-Harris window to a tolerance of $10^{-9}$. RFI is more easily identified in foreground-removed data, so we RFI-flagged again on the background data deviations greater than $3\sigma$. We then added the inside- and outside-horizon visibilities back together; RFI flags were preserved in the process. 

The effect of our calibration is shown in the delay-transformed visibilities in Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_delay_spectra}. As is apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_sky_image}, after improved calibration there are fewer delay tracks (i.e. sources) in the Stokes Q visibilities, while there is little overall change in Stokes U. The minimization of Stokes V, performed after the imaging calibration stage, moves power from Stokes V into Stokes U, effectively accounting for part of a $D$-term correction. But without an accurate $D$-term calibrator, Stokes U exhibits additional (and dominant) $D$-term leakage from Stokes I, 
in this case due to Pictor A. Pictor A is the brightest source in Stokes I in our observed field, and thus dominates the visibility shown.  There is no reason to suppose that Pictor A is pure Stokes U (compare also Figure \ref{fig:psa32_sky_image}), and thus the bulk of this emission must be leakage.

\subsection{Creating power spectra}
\label{subsec:psa32_create_pspec}
 

Expressing the visibility $V_{ij}^{pq}(\nu,t)$ observed at time $t$ (see Equation~\ref{eq:psa32_visibility}) in terms of the geometrical delay $\tau_g=\vec{b}(t) \cdot \hat{s}(l,m)/c$ for the baseline $ij$, \citet{Parsons.12a} define the delay transform as the Fourier transform of the visibility along the frequency axis:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{V}_{ij}^{pq}(\tau,t) = \int d\nu \, V_{ij}^{pq}(\nu,t) e^{2\pi i \nu \tau}
%\int dl\, dm\, d\nu\, A^{pq}_{ij}(l, m, \nu) S^{pq}_{ij}(l, m, \nu) e^{-2\pi i \nu (\tau_g - \tau)}
\end{equation}

We can represent the power at each frequency and baseline in an array as a power spectrum in terms of their respective Fourier components $k_{\parallel}$ and $k_{\perp}$ as:
\begin{equation}
P(k_{\parallel},k_{\perp}) \approx |\tilde{V}_{ij}^{pq}(\tau,t)|^2 \frac{X^2Y}{\Omega B}\left(\frac{c^2}{2k_B\nu^2}\right)^2
\label{eq:psa32_pspec}
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the bandwidth, $\Omega$ is the angular area (i.e. proportional to the beam area), and X and Y are redshift-dependent scalars calculated in \citet{Parsons.12b}. 

To form $|\tilde{V}_{ij}^{pq}(\tau,t)|^2$, consecutive integrations were cross-multiplied, phasing the zenith of latter to the former i.e.:
\begin{equation}
|\tilde{V}_{ij}^{pq}(\tau,t)|^2 \approx |{V}_{ij}^{pq}(\tau,t)\times {V}_{ij}^{pq}(\tau,t+\Delta t)e^{i\theta_{ij,{\rm zen}}(\Delta t)}|^2
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$=10.7 seconds and $\theta_{ij,{\rm zen}}(\Delta t)$ is the appropriate zenith rephasing factor. This method should avoid noise-biased power spectra except on very long baselines, which the PAPER configuration does not contain, while sampling essentially identical $k$-modes.  Note that this is the same method used by \citet{Pober.13} in their investigation of the unpolarized wedge.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:psa32_res}
Combining visibilities using Equation~\ref{eq:psa32_tokes}, we formed power spectra over frequencies 146--166\,MHz according to Equation~\ref{eq:psa32_pspec} using consecutive integrations for each Stokes visibility over time, and gridded our results into $k$-space, averaging in time. 
The $k_{\perp}$-axis is binned with a resolution of $4.65\times10^{-4}\,h$\,Mpc$^{-1}$ to slightly reduce gaps in $k$-space due to missing baselines. This gave an average bin occupancy of 1.7$\pm$0.9.
The resolution in $k_{\parallel}$ ($5.06\times10^{-4}\,h$\,Mpc$^{-1}$) is set by the 20\,MHz bandwidth with 500\,kHz resolution that we use in this analysis.
Note that the Blackman-Harris window used in the delay-filtering stage after forming Stokes visibilities correlates adjacent frequency bins, and hence $k_{\parallel}$ bins.
Each $(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ bin was normalized by its occupancy.

Two-dimensional power spectra have been proven as powerful tools for large dipole array experiments, not only for assessing cosmology but also in order to constrain instrumental and analytical systematics \citep[e.g.][]{Morales.12}. Polarization axes are a useful addition for such analyses, since we expect Stokes I to be approximately 3 orders of magnitude stronger than the other polarization products at the low radio frequencies and tens-of-arcminute scales native to PAPER observations \citep[e.g.][]{Pen.09, Moore.13} and when observing far from the Galactic Plane. This alone allows us to assume that much of the structure in the power spectra with power comparable to Stokes I is leakage. As we explore below, these leakage terms can come from direction-dependent effects \citep[e.g. wide-field beam leakage;][]{Carozzi.09} or direction independent ones \citep[e.g. Mueller matrix mixing via gain errors and $D$-terms;][]{TMS} and appear with high signal-to-noise in power spectra.

Briefly, the structure in Stokes I is consistent with a point-source-dominated field with a weak diffuse component. The other Stokes parameters are consistent with calibration errors and systematics: Stokes Q shows gain errors on specific antennae, Stokes U gives an estimate of possible D-term leakage, and any structure in V shows unaccounted-for systematics, due to D-terms or mis-oriented antennae.}
\label{fig:psa32_forks}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_forks} shows power spectra in `pitchfork' form \citep{Nithya.15a,Nithya.15b}, with $k_{\parallel}$ in negative and positive directions (according to the East and West horizons, marked in white (horizon) and orange (horizon+50\,ns delay, respectively). Each Stokes parameter pitchfork has its own interesting characteristics, which allow us to analyze different sky and instrument behaviors. The `wedges' described in the literature that define the EoR window are simply the average of negative and positive values of $k_{\parallel}$. While we focus on the pitchfork expression of the power spectra in our results, we also show them in wedge form in Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_wedges}\footnote{Note the difference in the power distribution within the horizon differs from that shown in the \citet{Pober.13} $V^{yy}$ wedge. That study used the PAPER 64-element, single-polarization imaging array to create power spectra in a `loud' field containing point sources and Galactic signal, causing their wedge to be `fuller' than the ones presented in this study.}.

Simplifying the results of \citet[][see their papers for a full discussion]{Nithya.15a,Nithya.15b}, we expect power from diffuse emission to appear at low values of $k_{\perp}$ and high values of $k_{\parallel}$, while point sources lie at all $k_{\parallel}$ (all over the sky) but are down-weighted by the primary beam, which is broad, leaving a concentration of the power close to the $k_{\parallel}=0$ line.

In Stokes I, we see the strongest power on most baselines arising at values $k_{\parallel}\approx 0$. This is expected in a situation of point sources that are relatively bright compared to any diffuse emission. Indeed, at the LSTs we observed at, several unresolved bright point sources transit the field (e.g. Figure~{\ref{fig:psa32_sky_image}}), while the dominant source of diffuse emission at these frequencies, the Galactic plane, was below the horizon. However, we do see strong super-horizon emission at $0.02 \leqslant k_{\perp} \leqslant 0.03$, biased towards negative $k_{\parallel}$ values. There is also a decrease in power with increasing $k_{\perp}$ -- both of these effects are consistent with the \citet{Nithya.15b} simulations of faint diffuse structure transiting zenith. 

The Stokes Q wedge shows a concentration of power close to $k_{\parallel}\approx 0$, similar to Stokes I.
The inherent low polarization fraction at our frequencies works in our favor in detecting gain errors, since Stokes Q is largely expected to be faint, and thus the gain errors causing leakage from I appear at high signal-to-noise there.
Indeed, this power decreases noticeably with more accurate gain amplitude calibration, but bright streaks at specific values of $k_{\perp}$ remain, suggesting lower-level residual gain calibration errors on select baselines.  Another possible source of power in Stokes Q stems from wide-field direction-dependent gain errors causing a non-smooth evolution of the sources on the edges of the beam. However, we would expect this effect to be biased towards horizon values of $k_{\parallel}$.

Power appears distributed in `pockets' in the Stokes U power spectrum, not strongly correlated with the distribution of power in I. Stokes I is able to leak into Stokes U via $D$-term leakage \citep{TMS, Geil.11}, which could occur at any post-amplification stage of observations, such as in cables or receivers. These leakages would be direction independent, and therefore uncorrelated in $k$-space. Such a mechanism could explain the behavior within Stokes U wedge. Before absolute calibration, similar structure is seen in the Stokes V power spectrum.

At these frequencies, Stokes V is thought to be intrinsically zero, with few exceptions. However, \citet{HBS.1.96} show that antennae rotated with respect to one another can produce erroneous Stokes V power via I$\rightarrow$V leakage.\footnote{
It should be noted that while such an error could plausibly have been made in the antenna placement for this imaging array, it is extremely unlikely that it would be made in the redundant PAPER configuration for EoR seasons. In these cases, the antennae were positioned to sub-cm accuracy.} This effect may explain some of the small pockets of power that remain in the Stokes V power spectrum after absolute calibration, although such an effect is also consistent with $D$-term leakage. The fact that power within the horizon was greater than the noise level may also have been due to I $\rightarrow$ V leakage through the primary beam.

The relationship between polarizations is highlighted in Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_high_kperp_slice}.
We show a slice of the wedges over $0.097<\,k_{\perp}\,<0.098\,h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ ($\sim$175\,m) for Stokes I, Q, U and V (right panels) and the average power over these slices as a function of $k_{\parallel}$ (left panel). The standard deviations for each Stokes parameter are shown as dotted lines. 
Dashed vertical lines show the horizon at $k_{\perp}$=0.097 (left) and super-horizon at $k_{\perp}$=0.098 (right).

A heartening aspect of Figure~\ref{fig:psa32_high_kperp_slice}, and indeed all of the power spectra in this work, is that the power in Stokes Q, U and V proves to be just as confined within the horizon as Stokes I. Whether the polarized Stokes parameters are due to real polarization or miscalibration, not enough spectral structure is being introduced to move emission into the EoR window. Outside of the horizon, Stokes I, Q and U are consistent with the noise level expected for this range of $k$-modes ($P_{\rm noise}\sim10^{9}$ mK$^2$($h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$), according to the formalism \citet{Parsons.12b} and assuming a system temperature $T_{\rm sys}=450\,$K \citep[e.g.][]{Moore.17}.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{sec:psa32_disc}

We have presented measurements of instrumental polarization leakage in PAPER-32 using 2D power spectra. These have allowed us to quantify some of the possible instrumental effects that could limit a statistical detection of the EoR within the wedge, diagnosed in the Fourier space most relevant EoR statistical detection experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first study of Q, U and V 2D power spectra at these $k$-modes. We have shown that power from Stokes Q, U and V is as confined to the wedge as Stokes I. Any calibration errors do not appear to spread power outside the horizon. 

In their study of 2D power spectra, \citet{Asad.15} reported evidence of polarized leakage into the EoR window at the sub-percent level, considering a $4^\circ$ degree field of view. Their study differs from this work not only over the field of view ($4^\circ$ versus almost whole-sky), but also in the observing mode (tracked versus drift scan) and in the different k-space probes by LOFAR's longer baselines. In this work the power spectrum is calculated on a per-baseline basis, whereas their study calculates power spectra for gridded data which are more prone to mode mixing effects \citep{Hazelton.13}.

Our results are expected, in principle, to be more prone to leakage contamination due to the intrinsic extremely wide field of view of the PAPER primary beams, however, we see no evidence of leakage in the EoR window down to our sensitivity limits even without correction for polarized beams that is instead included in \cite{Asad.15}. Our analysis indicates therefore that neither intrinsic polarized emission nor the PAPER primary beam are leaking power in the EoR window, although longer integrations are required to demonstrate that this is true down to the sensitivities required for EoR detection. 

We showed that systematics can be probed with high signal-to-noise using 2D polarized power spectra, using the inherently low polarization fraction at the frequencies PAPER observes at to our advantage. We found that gain errors on specific baselines were easily probed using Stokes Q power spectra. Gain errors appear as continuous streaks within the horizon at specific values of $k_{\perp}$, allowing us to diagnose the precision of the gain calibration on a per-baseline basis. This is much more difficult to do with only Stokes I power spectra in a non-redundant array, and can be accomplished quickly without imaging. While the features in the Stokes U power spectra are more difficult to attribute to specific baselines, they appear to be consistent with direction-independent leakage. 
Stokes V power is slightly higher than noise-level within the horizon, suggesting a small but unaccounted-for leakage term from Stokes I, an effect which was explored \cite{Nunhokee.17} -- and found to be consistent with beam-leaked signal from Stokes I.
