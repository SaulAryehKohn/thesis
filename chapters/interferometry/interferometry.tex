\chapter{Interferometry, Calibration \& Polarimetry}
\label{chapter:interferometry}

In this Chapter I wished to build a formalism around wide-field, polarized interferometric measurements that could be used throughout this work. Many traditional assumptions used in radio interferometry are broken in the case of the wide-field, fully-polarized, drift-scanning measurements native to interferometric EoR observations. In Section~\ref{sec:interferometry_vis}, I derive the equation describing the fundamental observable for an interferometer, called a ``visibility". Section~\ref{sec:interferometry_cal}, I describe calibration techniques relevant to this work and in Section~\ref{sec:interferometry_pol} I review some of the implications of the previous two sections for polarized measurements.

For a comprehensive review of interferometry from a more traditional perspective, see \cite{TMS}.

\section{The Visibility Equation}
\label{sec:interferometry_vis}

A radio interferometer (a term used interchangeably with ``interferometric array" for radio observations) is an ensemble of receiving elements, where each element's measurement is correlated with every other element's. The simplest case is a two-element interferometer, which we will focus on below. We assume (for now) that the elements are coplanar and identical.

\subsection{The Classical Visibility Equation}

Consider two receiving elements $i$ and $j$, separated by baseline vector $\vec{b}$. Suppose a plane wave of wavelength $\lambda$ is incident upon these elements, with direction of propagation $-\hat{s}$. The geometry of this interferometer is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:interferometry_2element}.

\label{fig:interferometry_2element}
\end{figure}

We can define the electromagnetic wave to have a frequency dependent phase, such that the electric field measured by element $i$ at time $t$ is

\begin{equation}
E_i = E_0 e^{-2\pi i \nu t}.
\end{equation}

The time difference between the arrival at $i$ and $j$ is called the ``geometrical delay", $\tau_g$:

\begin{equation}
\tau_g = \frac{\vec{b}\cdot\hat{s}}{c}
\end{equation}

and the electric field measured by element $j$ is

\begin{equation}
E_j = E_0 e^{-2\pi i \nu (t+\tau_g)}
\end{equation}

An interferometer is an instrument which correlates these electric fields together, integrating their product over some coherent time-scale. This correlation grants:

\begin{equation}
\langle E_i E_j^* \rangle 
= \lim_{T\rightarrow\inf}\frac{1}{2T}\int^T_{-T} E_i(t) E_j(t) {\rm d}t
= | E_0 |^2 e^{-2\pi i \nu \tau_g}
\end{equation}

where $e^{-2\pi i \nu \tau_g} = e^{-2\pi i \nu \vec{b}\cdot\hat{s}/c}$ is known as the ``fringe" term, due to its sinusoidal nature. We can generalize this relationship to include more than a single plane wave from direction $\hat{s}$. Many plane waves, from all directions, can be incident upon the interferometer at a given time and frequency. We can represent the power distribution on the sky as $S(\Omega)$, where $S(\Omega)$. However, no instrument is equally sensitive to radiation from every direction $\hat{s} \in \Omega$. Instead, an instrument has some sensitivity pattern -- a \textit{beam pattern} -- that tapers the power distribution on the sky into an ``observed sky",  $S'(\Omega) = A(\Omega)S(\Omega)$. 

These generalizations lead to the classical visibility equation:

\begin{equation}
V_{ij}(\nu) = \int A(\Omega, \nu) S(\Omega, \nu) e^{-2\pi i \nu \vec{b}\cdot\hat{s}/c} {\rm d}\Omega
\label{eq:classical_visibility}
\end{equation}

If we choose to represent the source direction in terms of directional cosines $\ell$ and $m$, and represent the baseline vector in units of wavelengths, $\vec{b}/\lambda=(u,v,w)$, we can perform a change of variables in Equation~\ref{eq:classical_visibility} to give

\begin{equation}
V_{ij}(u,v) = \int\int A(\ell, m)S(\ell, m) e^{-2\pi i (u\ell + vm + w\sqrt{1 - \ell^2 - m^2})} {\rm d}\ell {\rm d}m
\end{equation}

This relationship is often simplified by assuming only a small area of the sky is under observation -- that is, that $A(\ell,m)$ falls-off steeply from zenith -- and therefore $\ell^2$ and $m^2$ are small. This grants

\begin{equation}
V_{ij}(u,v) \approx e^{-2\pi i w} \int\int A(\ell, m)S(\ell, m) e^{-2\pi i (u\ell + vm)} {\rm d}\ell {\rm d}m
\end{equation}

which plainly casts $V(u,v)$ as the Fourier transform of the observed sky if $w$ is small. Modern low frequency interferometers used in this work greatly violate this approximation, the consequences of which I will discuss in the proceeding sections.
