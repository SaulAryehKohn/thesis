\chapter{Deep integrations on polarization with PAPER-128}
\label{chapter:eor_window_psa128}

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:eor_window_psa32img}, I presented polarized power spectra from a short integration -- a few hours of one night -- over a wide range of $k_{\perp}$-modes probed by the PAPER-32 polarized imaging array \citep{Kohn.16}. Chapter~\ref{chapter:eor_window_HERA} presented the first power spectral results from HERA. The HERA-19 commissioning array was small and dense, meaning that only a few $k_{\perp}$-modes were accessible. For that study, we averaged over 10 hours per night, for 8 consecutive nights {\color{red} (Kohn et al. 2018)}. This Chapter presents results from the PAPER-128 array. As described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:instruments},  PAPER-128 consisted of 128 antennas, 96 of which were arranged in a redundant grid, that over two years logged more than 1000 hours of observations. In this Chapter I present roughly one quarter of those overall observations (described in Section~\ref{sec:psa128_obs}). I show results of a deep integration on a very narrow range of $k_{\perp}$-modes (corresponding to $\sim$30\,m spacings of the redundant grid; Section~\ref{sec:psa128_results}) and discuss the implications for deep, fully-polarized integrations with large interferometers (Section~\ref{sec:psa128_conc}).

\section{Observations \& Reduction}
\label{sec:psa128_obs}


% describe Epochs, Seasons (good summary table in Ridhima's thesis)
%
% summary spreadsheets: watch the array die over time, more bad antennae with no.s < 64
% Season 1 epoch 1 FX failure - blue circles on antennas for diagram, red Xs for bad ants?
% concentration on Epoch 2 as longest, most well-behaved epoch
% Season 2 many dying antennas
%
%  S1E2: 
% - crosspol correction, bad JD identification (slices), 
% - xx,yy firstcal (single per epoch), 4pol+minV cal + omnixtalk, bl pull, 
% - linCLEAN, lstbin_{fg,fgsub}
% - (unpolarized) PicA (Jacobs13) CASA cal on lstbin_fg
% - Stokes I FRF on all 4pols of fgsub

\section{Discussion \& Conclusions}
\label{sec:psa128_conc}
% Pitch to "future work", to end the section
% -- levels predicted for detection of Q,U: Nunhokee, Asad
% -- challenges associated with very long integrations
% -- ionosphere
